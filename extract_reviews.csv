    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

If you’re coming for a small phone, this is basically the best you can get.GOOD:-Great performanceVersatile camerasSharp, bright displayVery portable and convenientStriking design - beautiful, lightweight, durable.Small yet bright OLED, HDR10 and Dolby Vision support.Good battery life for such a small phone.Excellent stereo speakers - loud and clear.Class-leading performance, 5G.BAD:-Minor update over iPhone 12 mini.No high refresh rate.Smaller notch is not small.The charger is not bundled.Even with its imperfections, it is the perfect smartphone for fans of compact phones. It is the phone you get if you want a small yet powerful flagship - it's that simple...

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

    You don't need a big phone for big power, and the iPhone 13 mini proves it with  some of the best cameras and performance in the business. If you’re coming for a small phone, this is basically the best you can get.GOOD:-Great performanceVersatile camerasSharp, bright displayVery portable and convenientStriking design - beautiful, lightweight, durable.Small yet bright OLED, HDR10 and Dolby Vision support.Good battery life for such a small phone.Excellent stereo speakers - loud and clear.Class-leading performance, 5G.BAD:-Minor update over iPhone 12 mini.No high refresh rate.Smaller notch is not small.The charger is not bundled.Even with its imperfections, it is the perfect smartphone for fans of compact phones.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    It’s a powerful and ultra smooth Device and no doubt on that. As far as size is concerned it is lovely and fits in the hand and pocket with super ease.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care.

    You don't need a big phone for big power, and the iPhone 13 mini proves it with  some of the best cameras and performance in the business. If you’re coming for a small phone, this is basically the best you can get.GOOD:-Great performanceVersatile camerasSharp, bright displayVery portable and convenientStriking design - beautiful, lightweight, durable.Small yet bright OLED, HDR10 and Dolby Vision support.Good battery life for such a small phone.Excellent stereo speakers - loud and clear.Class-leading performance, 5G.BAD:-Minor update over iPhone 12 mini.No high refresh rate.Smaller notch is not small.The charger is not bundled.Even with its imperfections, it is the perfect smartphone for fans of compact phones. It is the phone you get if you want a small yet powerful flagship - it's that simple...

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    You don't need a big phone for big power, and the iPhone 13 mini proves it with  some of the best cameras and performance in the business. If you’re coming for a small phone, this is basically the best you can get.GOOD:-Great performanceVersatile camerasSharp, bright displayVery portable and convenientStriking design - beautiful, lightweight, durable.Small yet bright OLED, HDR10 and Dolby Vision support.Good battery life for such a small phone.Excellent stereo speakers - loud and clear.Class-leading performance, 5G.BAD:-Minor update over iPhone 12 mini.No high refresh rate.Smaller notch is not small.The charger is not bundled.Even with its imperfections, it is the perfect smartphone for fans of compact phones. It is the phone you get if you want a small yet powerful flagship - it's that simple...

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    It’s a powerful and ultra smooth Device and no doubt on that. As far as size is concerned it is lovely and fits in the hand and pocket with super ease.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

    You don't need a big phone for big power, and the iPhone 13 mini proves it with  some of the best cameras and performance in the business. If you’re coming for a small phone, this is basically the best you can get.GOOD:-Great performanceVersatile camerasSharp, bright displayVery portable and convenientStriking design - beautiful, lightweight, durable.Small yet bright OLED, HDR10 and Dolby Vision support.Good battery life for such a small phone.Excellent stereo speakers - loud and clear.Class-leading performance, 5G.BAD:-Minor update over iPhone 12 mini.No high refresh rate.Smaller notch is not small.The charger is not bundled.Even with its imperfections, it is the perfect smartphone for fans of compact phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant.

My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

    You don't need a big phone for big power, and the iPhone 13 mini proves it with  some of the best cameras and performance in the business. If you’re coming for a small phone, this is basically the best you can get.GOOD:-Great performanceVersatile camerasSharp, bright displayVery portable and convenientStriking design - beautiful, lightweight, durable.Small yet bright OLED, HDR10 and Dolby Vision support.Good battery life for such a small phone.Excellent stereo speakers - loud and clear.Class-leading performance, 5G.BAD:-Minor update over iPhone 12 mini.No high refresh rate.Smaller notch is not small.The charger is not bundled.Even with its imperfections, it is the perfect smartphone for fans of compact phones.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone.

    You don't need a big phone for big power, and the iPhone 13 mini proves it with  some of the best cameras and performance in the business. If you’re coming for a small phone, this is basically the best you can get.GOOD:-Great performanceVersatile camerasSharp, bright displayVery portable and convenientStriking design - beautiful, lightweight, durable.Small yet bright OLED, HDR10 and Dolby Vision support.Good battery life for such a small phone.Excellent stereo speakers - loud and clear.Class-leading performance, 5G.BAD:-Minor update over iPhone 12 mini.No high refresh rate.Smaller notch is not small.The charger is not bundled.Even with its imperfections, it is the perfect smartphone for fans of compact phones. It is the phone you get if you want a small yet powerful flagship - it's that simple...

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    You don't need a big phone for big power, and the iPhone 13 mini proves it with  some of the best cameras and performance in the business. If you’re coming for a small phone, this is basically the best you can get.GOOD:-Great performanceVersatile camerasSharp, bright displayVery portable and convenientStriking design - beautiful, lightweight, durable.Small yet bright OLED, HDR10 and Dolby Vision support.Good battery life for such a small phone.Excellent stereo speakers - loud and clear.Class-leading performance, 5G.BAD:-Minor update over iPhone 12 mini.No high refresh rate.Smaller notch is not small.The charger is not bundled.Even with its imperfections, it is the perfect smartphone for fans of compact phones.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant.

I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    It’s a powerful and ultra smooth Device and no doubt on that. As far as size is concerned it is lovely and fits in the hand and pocket with super ease.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone.

My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

    You don't need a big phone for big power, and the iPhone 13 mini proves it with  some of the best cameras and performance in the business.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Let me sum up my mind here. I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.

    Pros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It's a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I'm not a photography enthusiast, but they're good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it's been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you're going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple's ""walled garden"" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.

    Its really a cool mobile. Only disadvantage is that it is not suitable for ppl whose job rely on the phone calls. Battery downs quickly and also has only recent 100 call logs.

    It’s a powerful and ultra smooth Device and no doubt on that. As far as size is concerned it is lovely and fits in the hand and pocket with super ease.

    Product is just fantastic but why 4 stars? The Cameras do not support Macro/Close-up shots. My iPhone SE 128GB 1st Generation from 2018 (cost me 34k) works and does it better. Apple continues to find new methods to irritate their loyal customers.

    You don't need a big phone for big power, and the iPhone 13 mini proves it with  some of the best cameras and performance in the business. If you’re coming for a small phone, this is basically the best you can get.GOOD:-Great performanceVersatile camerasSharp, bright displayVery portable and convenientStriking design - beautiful, lightweight, durable.Small yet bright OLED, HDR10 and Dolby Vision support.Good battery life for such a small phone.Excellent stereo speakers - loud and clear.Class-leading performance, 5G.BAD:-Minor update over iPhone 12 mini.No high refresh rate.Smaller notch is not small.The charger is not bundled.Even with its imperfections, it is the perfect smartphone for fans of compact phones. It is the phone you get if you want a small yet powerful flagship - it's that simple...
